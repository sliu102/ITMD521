Item 6
====================
## 1.  Ease of gathering, processing, and wrtting code to retrieve data:
  
### item1: Because we have practiced a lot to write MapReduce code, I think it is the easiest part of this homework.

### item2: It cost a lot of time to process data. However, to write sql script is not that hard.

### item3: This part is the hardest for me, because   I have to generate the jar file everytime I modified the code. And also we are not familiar with sqoop. It's efficient to gather and process data. 

### item4: Its syntax is similar to sql, but much more efficient.

### item5: Pig is easy to handle when you are familiar to its syntax.

##2. The reason why I choose Reducer is that we have practiced a lot in week 7, week 8 assignment.
