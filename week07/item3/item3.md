###The amount of resources currently in use is: 7GB

###From the results, we can draw a conclusion that:
####bz2<gz<txt and with combiner<without combiner on execution time.
####This is because compression reduces the space needed to store files, and it speeds up data transfer across the network or to or from disk(From textbook).
